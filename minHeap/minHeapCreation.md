Create a min heap class that supports:

- building a min heap from an array of integers
- inserting integers in the heap
- removing the heaps min / root value
- peaking at the heaps min / root value
- sifting integers up/down the heap (use this when inserting/removing ints)

array = [48, 12, 24, 7, 8, -5, 24, 391, 24, 56, 2, 6, 8, 41]

buildHeap(array) = [-5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 8, 24, 391, 24, 56, 12, 24, 48, 41]
