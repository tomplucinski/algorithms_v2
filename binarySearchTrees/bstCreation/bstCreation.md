Write a binary search tree class that supports 3 methods. Insert - insert values into BST, Remove - remove first instance of a given value in BST, and Contains - return true or false if given value exists in BST.

A valid BST has a value greater than the values of every node to its left, and has a value less than or equal to the values of every node to its right. Its children nodes can either be a valid BST or null.
