Implement a MinHeap class that supports:

- building a Min Heap from an input array of integers
- inserting integers into the heap
- removing the heaps minimum/root value
- peaking at the heaps minimum/root value
- shifting integers up/down the heap, use this when inserting/removing values

The heap should be represented in the form of an array.
